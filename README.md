# DiceThrower

DiceThower, as the name suggests, is an application in which you can throw basic and unusual dice. The use of this application can be while playing TTRPG and other games.

The application is written in the Kotlin language and created by Android Studio. I created it to learn the basic functions of Android Studio, Git, and Kotlin.
